<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Temiskaming Hospital is a modern and spacious facility built in 1980. We serve the City of Temiskaming Shores and area which includes the surrounding 4,200 square miles, bringing the total population served to about 25,000 people. The Hospital is a 59 bed facility, which is comprised of 40 acute beds, 11 chronic beds, 5 obstetric beds and 3 special care unit beds. Temiskaming Hospital’s team consists of 219 employees (of which 110 are full time and 109 are part time). The Medical Staff consists of 17 full time and 2 part time family practitioners, 3 general surgeons, 1 internist, 3 general practitioner anesthetists, 1 family doctor specializing in geriatrics, 1 visiting pathologist and 3 visiting radiologists.</p>
<p>Approximately 21 visiting specialists conduct regular outpatient clinics in disciplines such as cardiology, neurology, nephrology, obstetrics and gynecology, orthotics, rehab/physical medicine, psychiatry, ophthalmology and pediatrics. We are proud to be a member of Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), one of Canada’s leading telemedicine service providers and the largest videoconference-based network in Ontario. Using live, two-way videoconferencing and electronic medical devices, we are able to participate in medical specialist consultations for patients and continuing education for health professionals.</p>
<p>We are affiliated with the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, providing third year clerkship students with their entire academic year. Our local medical staff is encouraged to apply for faculty status with the medical school whose main campuses are in Sudbury and Thunder Bay. Since academic year 2007/08, we have been involved with the Northern Ontario School of Medicine as one of the twelve sites providing their longitudinal clinical clerkship on an annual basis. We also provide additional student and resident placements.</p>
<p>The Hospital’s affiliation with Sudbury Regional Hospital enables us to provide on-site services in dialysis and chemotherapy. A general practitioner can practice a wide array of medicine – including office practice, assisting in the operating room, working in the emergency room and providing obstetrical call. A host of diagnostic testing is available with our most recent acquisition being a 64-slice CT scanner. The result of our planning in ambulatory care has allowed us to establish a day surgery program and day medicine program.</p>
<p>We have recently conducted renovations to bring our facility up to the 21st century standards – including major upgrades to our emergency room and the addition of accommodations for the Stepping Stones Day Care.</p>
