<h2>Volunteering at Temiskaming Hospital</h2>

<br />
    Temiskaming Hospital is very grateful to our dedicated Volunteers who give freely of their time to enhance the quality of our patient’s stay in this facility. Our patients benefit in many ways from these interactions whether it be on a physical, cognitive, emotional, or spiritual basis. The social interaction enhances ones communication skills and helps develop a sense of belonging. The Volunteers in our building come from all walks of life, male and female, young and old.
<br />

<br /><br />
    Students have the opportunity to learn about careers in health care and complete their mandatory volunteer hours.
