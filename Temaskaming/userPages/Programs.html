<h3 style="text-align:start"><strong>Cardiac Rehabilitation</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:start">The Cardiac Rehabilitation program at Temiskaming Hospital in New Liskeard is a satellite site of the Sudbury Regional Hospital.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">Cardiac Rehabilitation is a medically supervised program to assist in recovery after heart attack or heart surgery.The program includes education on heart-healthy living, stress management and graduated exercise training over a 12-week period. The lifestyle changes made during Cardiac Rehab have been shown to improve overall health and help prevent future heart problems.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:start"><span><strong>Infection Control</strong></span></h3>

<p style="text-align:start">Infection Control has become an integral part in the health promotion and safety of both patients and staff at Temiskaming Hospital. The department, in collaboration with the Infection Control Committee, is involved in everything from construction and renovation, to occupational health, and patient safety. Collaboratively, we develop and implement practices aimed at preventing the spread of infection within the hospital, and maintaining patient and staff safety.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">Due to the emergence of more virulent strains of infection, more attention has been given to prevention of the spread of these &ldquo;superbugs&rdquo; through education, surveillance, and isolation of positive cases of C-Difficile, MRSA, VRE, and other infections that are spread through contact, or respiratory routes. As well, provincial guidelines now require that we do surveillance on hand hygiene compliance, surgical site infection and prophylactic antibiotics, which again allow the public to be more aware, and potentially more involved in their own healthcare. Again, the focus of the infection control department is to ensure that Temiskaming Hospital provides care in a safe and effective environment for both patients and staff alike.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">We are committed to achieving an integrated approach to Quality, Risk Management and Patient Safety. (((insert image))) Our integrated program involves three levels of leadership that takes place at the governance, medical and operational levels.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">To support our process, the following committees are in place: The Quality &amp; Service Planning Committee serves as the leadership team responsible for quality at the governance level; The Quality Care/Medical Audit, Tissue &amp; Transfusion Committee deals with medical clinical quality; and The Quality &amp; Safety Integration Team deals with operational quality and patient safety. There is representation from all departments on this</p>
